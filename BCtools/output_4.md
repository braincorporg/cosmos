harnessed when scaling up the size and inducing regional
polarization, thereby increasing the biological complexity of neural
networks and interregional connections to better re ﬂect brain
architecture and function ( 48,208 –213). Bioprinting approaches
might also help here.
Ethics of biological computing
with organoids
Creating a human brain model with input and output as well as
learning capabilities raises complex ethical questions. At 12 weeks of
fetal development, a human brain has a weight of approximately 3 g,
a volume of approximately 3.5 ml, and 3 × 109cells in the neocortical
part of the fetal telencephalon ( 214 –216). An adult mouse brain
weighs approximately 0.4 g. In comparison, current brain organoids
have a diameter below 500 mm in culture, with less than 100,000
cells. The maturation of the brain organoid is accelerated by growth
factors so that at 10 weeks of culture, organoids show some features
(such as myelination) that start in the fetus after 20 weeks of
gestation ( 217). Furthermore, the stimulation with information
input might lead to very different organoid development, and
much longer culture periods would be envisaged for training
organoids, together possibly augmenting cognitive capabilities.
The ethical concerns raised by brain organoid research have
mainly focused on questions about creating entities that could
potentially exhibit consciousness ( 45). Could organoids
experience pain and, if so, would they suffer –even in
rudimentary ways? These concerns will mount during the
development of OI, as the organoids become structurally more
complex, receive inputs, generate outputs, and –at least
theoretically –process information about their environment and
build a primitive memory. This will require deeper analysis and
research regarding the morally salient neurobiological features thatcontribute to human capacities, including consciousness, and the
implications for OI research and implementation when some or all
of these are met. Articulating the physiological conditions that are
necessary and suf ﬁcient for consciousness is one of the most dif ﬁcult
puzzles of neuroscience ( 143,218). To assess whether organoids
exhibit the criteria for consciousness will require some consensus to
be reached about what those criteria are ( 219). Work underway to
uncover the neural basis of consciousness will inform the evaluation
of the ethical issues raised by OI. However, it will also be important
to distinguish “consciousness ”from “sentience, ”formally
considered as “awareness to stimuli, ”i.e. response to sensory
input ( 220,221). Such use of terminology can be debated and
represents a critical challenge for the forming OI community. We
use the term “sentience ”in its most basic way, similar to the way in
which many aspects of cognition have to be understood as very
basic cellular mechanisms, not human-level brain functions. Even
recent proposals ( 222) for the use of the perturbational complexity
index (PCI) assume the more complex idea of phenomenological
consciousness when the behavior could be explained by simpler
sentience ( 174). Notably, the suggested OI program does not aim to
recreate human consciousness, but rather functional aspects related
to learning, cognition, and computing.Nevertheless, as advances in the structural and functional
complexity of OI systems begin to recapitulate aspects of human
neurobiological (sub)-processes, such as learning and cognition,
researchers will inevitably e ncounter the Greely Dilemma: a
situation whereby incremental successes in modelling aspects of
the human brain will raise the same kind of ethical concerns that
originally motivated their development (
223). Suf ﬁcient advances in
OI will raise questions about the moral status of these entities and
concerns for their welfare. Frameworks have been proposed to
address these ethical concerns in research practices ( 224,225) but it
remains unknown whether these proposals adequately attend to
moral concerns held by the public. For example, harm reduction
policies are often unsuccessful in gaining public support when the
underlying attitude is based on a moral conviction ( 226) with
implications for public discourse ( 227). Comprehensive ethical
analysis of OI will require input from diverse publics and relevant
stakeholder groups ( 228), in order to (i) prevent misunderstandings
from creating unintended moral appraisals, and (ii) and foster trust,
conﬁdence, and inclusion through responsible public engagement.
Notably, moral attitudes toward OI may depend less on
epistemological concerns mentioned above, such as the role of
speciﬁc cognitive capacities in assessments of moral status, and
more on ontological arguments of what constitutes a human being.
Perceptions of (re)creating ‘human-like ’entities in the lab are likely
to evoke concerns about infringing on human dignity that could
reﬂect secular or theological beliefs about the ‘essential ’nature of
the human being ( 229,230). Our approach to embedded ethics in
OI will seek to identify and attend to these ethical concerns by
informing future public engagement and deliberation on OI.
Other issues anticipated to require attention include privacy
concerns on the part of iPSC donors and aspects of intellectual
property. What does the organoid exhibit about the cell donor? Is
there a moral obligation to inform the donor if, for example,
something relevant to their health is identi ﬁed during research?
Do donors have rights that extend beyond the donation?
In common with other scienti ﬁc and bioengineering aspects of
OI, this is truly uncharted territory. The ethical considerations
and viewpoints can be expected to evolve with an increased
understanding of organoid syste ms. It is therefore critical to
frame the ethical considerations at the onset of this research in
a manner that encompasses all anticipated issues, and which
continually re ﬂects on progress and new lessons. We propose to
use an “embedded ethics ”approach whereby an ethics team will
identify, discuss, and analyze ethical issues as they arise in the
course of this work. Embedded ethics is a standard approach in
interdisciplinary ethics research, whereby expert ethicists join and
collaborate integrally with res earch and development teams to
consider and address ethical issues viaan iterative and continuous
process as the research evolves ( 231).Box 1 offers a preliminary
framework of ethical considerations informed by discussions at
the “First organoid intelligence (OI) workshop to form an OI
community ”workshop (22 –24 February 2022) ( 51).
While the embedded ethics approach provides a mechanism for
investigating the philosophical and scienti ﬁc conditions relevant to the
moral status of brain organoids, it has no inherent mechanisms for
seeking, identifying, or incorporating public values in the developmentSmirnova et al. 10.3389/fsci.2023.1017235

of OI. It is important to understand public perceptions of OI, and this
cannot be delegated to ethicists alone. It needs to be embedded within
theﬁeld as a three-way feedback loop involving researchers, ethicists,
and members of the public, including stakeholders who could be
especially impacted by advances in OI (e.g. neurodiversity advocates).
This feedback loop will enable speci ﬁc applications of OI to be
articulated by researchers, analyzed by ethicists based on theoretical
principles, and evaluated by members of the public with diverse moral
perspectives. The views expressed by the public then inform the work
of both scientists and ethicists seeking to advance OI in a socially
responsive manner. This call for public dialogue has been echoed by a
National Academy of Sciences report on human neural organoids
(232), the recommendations on innovation in neurotechnology by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( 233),
and various neuroethics committees. Moreover, researchers in science
communication and deliberative de mocracy have demonstrated that
deliberative techniques are one of the most effective mechanisms for
informing the public and mitigating the risk of polarization on
contentious issues. Finally, public engagement on OI will not only
be necessary to prevent adverse public reactions but will also maximize
the future impact of the ﬁeld and serve as an exemplar of how to
embed society within science.Of relevance in this context, coauthor JK co-chaired the
neuroethics subcommittee for the new strategic plan for NIH
BRAIN 2.0 ( 234). The only project we know of with relevant
parallel aspects is the Brainstorm Project led by Insoo Hyun at
Case Western University ( 235). We will be further actively promoting
discussions between biologists, ethicists, and philosophers who are
interested in brain organoids and navigating brain organoid ethics in
research, as we did before ( 219). A recommended way forward would
include: (1) an agreement on commonly used language, (2) the need
for research on the neural basis for consciousness (as above); and (3)
the development of best practice guidelines that consider the views of
all relevant stakeholders.
Conclusion: an action plan
for OI research
We present a collaborative, iterative multidisciplinary program
aiming to establish OI as a form of genuine biological computing that
harnesses brain organoids using the scienti ﬁc and bioengineering
approaches described here in an ethically responsible manner
(Figure 5 ). Ultimately, we aim toward a revolution in biologicalBOX 1 Preliminary framework of ethical considerations in organoid intelligence research. Organoid intelligence research entails many important
ethical aspects that warrant an iterative, collaborative ethical process as the ﬁeld develops, involving all relevant stakeholders. Here we offer a
preliminary framework of issues for consideration.

computing that could overcome many of the limitations of silicon-
based computing and AI and have signi ﬁcant implications
worldwide. Speci ﬁcally, we anticipate OI-based biocomputing
systems to allow faster decision-making (including on massive,
incomplete, and heterogenous datasets), continuous learning during
tasks, and greater energy and data ef ﬁciency. Furthermore, the
development of “intelligence-in-a-dish ”offers unparalleled
opportunities to elucidate the biological basis of human cognition,
learning, and memory, together with various disorders associated
with cognitive de ﬁcits –potentially aiding the identi ﬁcation of novel
therapeutic approaches to address major global unmet needs.
