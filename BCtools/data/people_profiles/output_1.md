Abstract
Recent advances in human stem cell-derived brain organoids promise to replicate
critical molecular and cellular aspects of learning and memory and possiblyaspects of cognition in vitro . Coining the term “organoid intelligence ”(OI) to
encompass these developments, we present a collaborative program to
implement the vision of a multidisciplinary ﬁeld of OI. This aims to establish OI as
a form of genuine biological computing that harnesses brain organoids using
scienti ﬁc and bioengineering advances in an ethically responsible manner.
Standardized, 3D, myelinated brain o rganoids can now be produced with high
cell density and enriched levels of glial cells and gene expression critical for learning.
Integrated micro ﬂuidic perfusion systems can support scalable and durable

Introduction
Human brains are slower than machines at processing simple
information, such as arithmetic, but they far surpass machines in
processing complex information as brains deal better with few and/or
uncertain data. Brains can perform both sequential and parallel
processing (whereas computers c an do only the former), and they
outperform computers in decision-making on large, highly
heterogeneous, and incomplete dat asets and other challenging forms
of processing. The processing power of the brain is illustrated by the
observation that in 2013, the world ’s fourth-largest computer took 40
minutes to model 1 second of 1% of a human ’sb r a i na c t i v i t y( 1).
Moreover, each brain has a storag e capacity estimated at 2,500 TB,
based on its 86 –100 billion neurons having more than 1015connections
(2,3). In this article, we describe the emerging ﬁeld that we term
“organoid intelligence ”(OI), which aims to leverage the extraordinary
biological processing power of the brain.Smirnova et al. 10.3389/fsci.2023.1017235

Super ﬁcially, both biological learning and machine learning/AI by
an intelligent agent bui ld internal representations of the world to
improve their performance in conduc ting tasks. However, fundamental
differences between biologic al and machine learning in the
mechanisms of implementation and their goals result in two
drastically different ef ﬁciencies. First, biological learning uses far less
power to solve computational problems. For example, a larval zebra ﬁsh
navigates the world to successfully hunt prey and avoid predators ( 4)
u s i n go n l y0 . 1m i c r o w a t t s( 5), while a human adult consumes 100
watts, of which brain consumption constitutes 20% ( 6,7). In contrast,
clusters used to master state-of-the-art machine learning models
typically operate at around 106w a t t s .S i n c eJ u n e2 0 2 2 ,t h eU S A ’s
Frontier has been the world ’s most powerful superc omputer, reaching
1102 petaFlops (1.102 exaFlops) on the LINPACK benchmarks. The
power consumption of the new supe rcomputer is 21 megawatts, while
the human brain operates at the estimated same 1 exaFlop and
consumes only 20 watts ( Table 1 )(8–11). Thus, humans operate at a
106-fold better power ef ﬁciency relative to modern machines albeit
while performing quite different tasks.
Second, biological learning uses fewer observations to learn how
to solve problems. For example, humans learn a simple “same-versus-
different ”task using around 10 training samples ( 12); simpler
organisms, such as honeybees, also need remarkably few samples
(~102)(13). In contrast, in 2011, machines could not learn these
distinctions even with 106samples ( 14) and in 2018, 107samples
remained insuf ﬁcient ( 15). Thus, in this sense, at least, humans
operate at a >106times better data ef ﬁciency than modern
machines. The AlphaGo system, which beat the world champion at
the complex game Go, offers a concrete illustration ( 16,17). AlphaGo
was trained on data from 160,000 games ( 17); a human playing for
ﬁve hours/day would have to play continuously for more than 175
years to experience the same number of training games –indicatingthe far higher ef ﬁciency of the brain in this complex learning activity.
The implication is that AI and machine-learning approaches have
limited usefulness for tasks requiring real-time learning and dynamic
actions in a changing environment. The power and ef ﬁciency
advantages of biological computing over machine learning are
multiplicative. If it takes the same amount of time per sample in a
human or machine, then the total energy spent to learn a new task
requires 1010times more energy for the machine. AlphaGo was
trained for 4 weeks using 50 graphics processing units (GPUs) ( 17),
requiring approximately 4 ×1010J of energy –about the same amount
of energy required to sustain the metabolism of an active adult
human for a decade. This high energy consumption prevents AI from
achieving many aspirational goals, for example matching or
exceeding human capabilities for complex tasks such as driving
(18). Even large multinational corporations are beginning to reach
the limits of machine learning owing to its inef ﬁciencies ( 19), and the
associated exponential increase in energy consumption is
unsustainable ( 20), especially if technology companies are to adhere
to their commitments to become carbon negative by 2030 ( 21,22). At
a national level, already in 2016 it took the equivalent of 34 coal-
powered plants, each generating 500 megawatts, to meet the power
demands of US-based data centers ( 23). Being much more energy
efﬁcient than current computers, human brains could theoretically
meet the same US data storage capacity using only 1,600 kilowatts of
energy. Notably, the power demands of any current or future
implementation of OI is very different from the energy
consumption of the human body, especially considering the energy
footprint of modern cell culture relative to small organoids today.
These comparisons of brains and computers serve only as
illustrations of the high ef ﬁciency of the human brain.
Together, these observations have created high expectations for
biological, brain-directed computing ( 24–26) as an alternative to
silicon-based computing, with the potential for unprecedented
advances in computing speed, processing power, data ef ﬁciency,
and storage capabilities –all with lower energy needs. However,
realizing the potential of biocomputing has proved challenging, and
most research remains in its infancy. To date, the term “biological
computing ”has been used mainly to describe the use of DNA to store
digital data ( 27,28). An exception to this is the recent work by Kagan
et al. ( 29), which uses the term “synthetic biological intelligence ”
(SBI) to describe the use of synthetic biology to generate intelligent
systems through brain-directed computing, albeit using only simple
2D monolayer cell cultures (which poorly replicate the complexity of
thein vivo brain) as a proof-of-concept.
We have coined the term “organoid intelligence ”(OI) to describe
an emerging ﬁeld aiming to expand the de ﬁnition of biocomputing
toward brain-directed OI computing, i.e. to leverage the self-assembled
machinery of 3D human brain cell cultures (brain organoids) to
memorize and compute inputs. Brai n organoids recapitulate organ
histoarchitecture and functionality far more closely than traditional 2D
cultures. They can contain myelinated axons ( 30–32) and not only
show spontaneous electro physiological activity ( 33)b u ta l s o
demonstrate complex oscillatory behavior ( 34), and exhibit high cell
density and layering patterns, all of which make brain organoids
superior to traditional monolayer cultures ( 34–36). The question is:
can we learn from and harness the computing capacity of theseTABLE 1 Comparison of the latest supercomputer (June 2022) and a

organoids? Achieving this will require major advances in the
interfacing of brain cell cultures and computers. We envision using
biofeedback to systematically train organoids with increasingly
complex sensory inputs an d output opportunities –interfacing the
brain organoids with computers, se nsors, and machi ne interfaces to
facilitate supervised and unsupervised learning. We use the term “OI”
for this approach to stress its complementarity to AI –where
computers aim to perform tasks done by brains, often by modeling
our understanding of learning. However, while AI aims to make
computers more brain-like, OI research will explore how a 3D brain
cell culture can be made more computer-like.
The many possible applications of this work include a new
generation of biological and hybrid ( biological-electronic) computing
technologies, together with adv ances in our understanding of the
physiology of cognition, learning, and memory, and the
pathophysiological effects of d evelopmental and degenerative
diseases, intoxication, and infection –which in turn could stimulate
drug development and other interve ntions. OI also has the potential to
unlock new neuromimetic AI algorithms (with the potential to
overcome current AI limitations )a n da i dt h ed e v e l o p m e n to fn e w
brain-computer-interface technology.
The concept of brain-machine interfacing emerged around ﬁve
decades ago. Before the advent of more complex human neuronal
cultures and brain organoids, pioneering work on learning and
memory was carried out using primitive animals such as the
lamprey, showing long-term potentiation ( 37). This led to brain-
machine interaction studies e stablishing bidirectional
communications between the nervous system and external devices
(38). Others used brain slices of different species to study the basic
phenomena of learning on a cellular level ( 39). Neuron cultures
were later shown to perform simple robotic tasks or demonstrate
increased plasticity within a delayed closed-loop environment ( 40,
41). The combination of brain cell cultures and computers has also
been attempted: 2D cultured rat neurons displayed evidence of self-organized activity in a computational task (blind source separation)
when supplied with electrical information ( 42). A different study
showed that these cultures learned to respond in the form of distinct
electrophysiological patterns to low-frequency focal stimuli ( 43,44).
To the best of our knowledge, however, no relevant approach using
brain organoids as learning systems h as been reported. Previous research
has demonstrated spontaneous electrophysiological signals and
synchronous neural network activity of dissociated organoids ( 45),
sliced organoids ( 46), or developing full organoids ( 34,47), and
advanced manipulation of neural circuits within assembloids
(organoids merging two distinct brai n regions) was recently published
(48). The only study resembling our vision is the recent work by Kagan
et al. ( 29), which embedded monolayers of cortical neurons in a real-time
closed-loop environment viaelectrophysiological stimulation and
recording. These cultures self-organi zed to rapidly alter their activity to
display goal-directed behavior in a simulated game environment.
Similarly, the European Union-funded NEU-CHiP project aims to
demonstrate the growth of layered networks of brain stem cells on
microchips ( 49). In addition, the Human Brain Project models similar
(but virtual) input-brain output machine models ( 50).Obviously, terms such as “cognition, ”“intelligence, ”“sentience, ”
and “consciousness, ”describing human capabilities, cannot be
directly translated to simple cell culture models; they are used here
to describe the realization of basic functions underlying these higher-
order functionalities. A workshop to de ﬁne adequate terminology for
theﬁeld is in preparation. Please see the glossary included, which
attempts to provide de ﬁnitions in the context of this manuscript.
In this article, we present an architecture ( Figure 1 )a n d
blueprint for an OI development and implementation program
designed to:
Determine the biofeedback characteristics of existing
human brain organoids caged in microelectrode shells,potentially using AI to analyze recorded response patterns
to electrical and chemical (neurotransmitters and their
corresponding receptor agonists and antagonists) stimuli.
Empirically test, re ﬁne, and, where needed, develop
neurocomputational theories that elucidate the basis of in
vivobiological intelligence and allow us to interact with and
harness an OI system.
Further scale up the brain organoid model to increase the
quantity of biological matter, the complexity of brain
organoids, the number of electrodes, algorithms for real-
time interactions with brain organoids, and the connected
input sources and output devices; and to develop big-data
warehousing and machine learning methods to
accommodate the resulting brain-directed computing
capacity.
Explore how this program could improve our understanding
of the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative disorders toward innovative approaches
to treatment or prevention.
Establish a community and a large-scale project to realize
OI computing, taking full account of its ethical implications
and developing a common ontology.
To the latter point, a community-forming workshop was held in
February 2022 ( 51), which gave rise to the Baltimore Declaration
Toward OI ( 52). It provides a statement of vision for an OI
community that has led to the development of the program
outlined here.
